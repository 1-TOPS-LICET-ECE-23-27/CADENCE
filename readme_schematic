CMOS Inverter Design using Cadence Virtuoso 
Overview
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a CMOS inverter using Cadence Virtuoso with the GPDK 180nm process. It includes schematic creation, DC analysis to extract the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC), and transient analysis to evaluate switching behavior.
Tools and Environment
- EDA Tool: Cadence Virtuoso (version X.X)
- Simulator: Spectre via ADE L or ADE XL
- Process Technology: GPDK 180nm
- Operating System: Linux (e.g., RHEL/CentOS

Procedure
1. Library Setup
- Launch Virtuoso: virtuoso &
- Create a new library: File → New → Library
- Name: cmos_inv_lib
- Attach to techfile: gpdk180
2. Schematic Creation
- Create a new cell view: File → New → CellView
- Cell Name: cmos_inverter
- View: schematic
- Add components:
- PMOS (pmos4) and NMOS (nmos4) from the GPDK180 library
- VDD and GND symbols
- Input source: vpulse for transient or vdc for DC
- Output wire
- Connect using Add → Wire (narrow)
- Check and save: Design → Check and Save
3. DC Analysis
- Open ADE L: Launch → ADE L
- Set simulator to Spectre
- Add input source as vdc and sweep from 0 to VDD (e.g., 1.8V)
- Go to Analysis → Choose → DC
- Sweep variable: Vin
- Sweep range: 0 to 1.8V
- Add output expression: Vout
- Run simulation: Simulation → Netlist and Run
- Save the VTC plot
4. Transient Analysis
- Replace vdc with vpulse for input
- Set rise/fall time, pulse width, and period appropriately
- In ADE L, go to Analysis → Choose → Transient
- Time range: e.g., 0 to 20ns
- Add Vin and Vout to outputs
- Run simulation and observe switching behavior
- Save waveform plots
Results
- DC Analysis: Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) curve
- Transient Analysis: Switching waveform showing inverter delay and transition behavior
Notes
- Ensure the GPDK180 techfile is correctly attached to the library.
- Use Design → Check and Save before simulation to avoid errors.
- For layout, DRC, and LVS, extend this project using Virtuoso Layout Editor.
